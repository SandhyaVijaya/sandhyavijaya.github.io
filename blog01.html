            <p>Hello there, curious visitor!</p>

            <p>Welcome to my blog, where we're all about unraveling the mysteries of web development, one line of code at a time :)</p>

            <p>I started this blog as part of a web development course in university, both as an assignment as well as a way to organise
                the information I've picked up throughout those classes. Never ending lectures and wordy documentation have their place
                in learning, but this blog is all about concise and easy-to-digest information. Whether you're just starting out with web
                development, reading up before class or need a quick review before that exam, you'll find what you need here!
            </p>
            
            <p>Follow along cause we'll be rolling up our sleeves, diving headfirst into the world of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more.</p>
