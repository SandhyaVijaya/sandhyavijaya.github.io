        <h2>Version Control with Git and Github</h2>
        <p class="date">10th February 2024</p>
        <article>
            <p>In the dynamic world of software development, collaboration and code management are everywhere. As projects grow in
            complexity and involve multiple contributors, the need for robust version control systems becomes evident. Among the
            plethora of tools available, Git stands out as a versatile and powerful version control system, with GitHub serving as a
            popular platform for hosting Git repositories. In this blog post, we'll delve into the fundamentals of version control
            with Git and GitHub.</p>

            <h3>What is Version Control?</h3>
            <p>Version control is the practice of tracking and managing changes to source code over time. It allows developers to work
            collaboratively on projects, maintain a history of modifications, and revert to previous states if necessary.</p>

            <h3>Key Concepts of Git</h3>
            <p><b>Repository (Repo):</b> A repository is a collection of files and folders associated with a project, along with metadata stored in a hidden
            directory named .git. Git repositories can be local (on your machine) or remote (hosted on a server).</p>
            <p><b>Commit:</b> A commit represents a snapshot of changes to the repository at a specific point in time. Each commit is accompanied by a
            unique identifier (SHA-1 hash) and a commit message describing the modifications made.</p>
            <p><b>Branch:</b> A branch is a parallel version of the repository's codebase, allowing developers to work on features or fixes
            independently without affecting the main codebase (typically the main branch).</p>
            <p><b>Merge:</b> Merging combines changes from one branch into another, integrating new features or bug fixes into the main codebase. Git
            performs automatic merging whenever possible, but conflicts may arise that require manual resolution.</p>
            <p><b>Fork:</b> A fork refers to creating a personal copy of someone else's repository. When you fork a repository, you're
            essentially making a duplicate of the original repository under your GitHub account.</p>
            <p><b>Pull Request:</b> A pull request allows developers to propose changes to a repository. It serves as a formal request to the original repository's owner
            to pull in changes from a forked repository.</p>
            <br>
            
            <h3>Getting Started with Git</h3>
            <p><b>Install Git:</b> The most official build is available for download on the Git website. Just go to <a href="https://git-scm.com/">https://git-scm.com/</a></p>
            <p><b>First Time Set Up:</b> The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and email address, using the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:</p>
            <p><i>$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"</i></p>
            <p><i>$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com</i></p>
            <p><b>Create a Repository:</b> Navigate to the directory where you want to initialize your Git repository. Use the following command to initialize a new Git repository in the folder 'project':</p>
            <p><i>$ cd C:/Users/user/project</i></p>
            <p><i>git init</i></p>
            <p>Alternatively, if you wish to clone an exisiting repo use: <i>$ git clone url</i></p>
            <br>

            <h3>Basic Git Commands</h3>
            <p><i>git add</i>: Add changes to the staging area.</p>
            <p><i>git commit</i>: Save changes to the repository with a descriptive commit message.</p>
            <p><i>git status</i>: Check the status of your working directory and staging area.</p>
            <p><i>git log</i>: View the commit history of your repository.</p>
            <p><i>git push</i>: Push your commits to a remote repository (like GitHub).</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>Version control with Git and GitHub has revolutionized the way software development teams collaborate, manage code, and
            streamline workflows. By leveraging these powerful tools, developers can work more efficiently, maintain code quality,
            and foster a culture of collaboration within their organizations. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting
            your coding journey, mastering Git and GitHub is essential for success in today's fast-paced software development
            landscape.</p>
