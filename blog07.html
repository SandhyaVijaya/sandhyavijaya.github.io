        <p class="date">15th February 2024</p>
        <article>
            <p>In the realm of web development, forms serve as the bridge between users and websites, enabling interactions such as
            submitting inquiries, making purchases, and providing feedback. Understanding how to create HTML forms is essential for
            any aspiring web developer. In this comprehensive guide, we'll delve into the intricacies of crafting HTML forms from
            scratch, covering everything from basic form elements to advanced form validation techniques.</p>

            <p>
                HTML forms are integral to gathering information from users and facilitating user engagement on websites. Whether it's a
                simple contact form or a multi-step registration process, forms empower websites to collect data and interact with
                visitors dynamically.

            <h3>Basic HTML Form Structure</h3>
            <p><b>&lt;form&gt;:</b> This tag encloses all form elements and defines how data is sent to the server upon submission. The action attribute
            specifies the URL where the form data will be sent, and the method attribute defines the HTTP method (e.g., GET or POST)
            used to submit the form data.</p>
            <p><b>&lt;label&gt;:</b> Labels are used to describe form inputs, improving accessibility and user experience. The for attribute links the label
            to its corresponding input element via the id attribute.</p>
            <p><b>&lt;input&gt;:</b> Input elements are used to collect data from users. Common types include text, email, password, checkbox, radio buttons,
            and submit buttons. The type attribute determines the input type, while the name attribute provides a key for
            identifying the input data when the form is submitted.</p>
            <p><b>&lt;textarea&gt;:</b> Textareas allow users to input multiple lines of text. The rows and cols attributes define the size of the textarea.</p>
            <p><b>&lt;button&gt;:</b> Buttons can trigger form submission or perform other actions within the form.</p>

            <h3>Form Validation</h3>
            <p><i>&lt;input type="email" id="email" name="email" required&gt;</i></p>
            <p>HTML5 introduced built-in form validation features that allow developers to specify input requirements without using
            JavaScript. Adding the required attribute to an input element makes it mandatory, while input types such as email, url,
            and number automatically validate the input format.</p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>HTML forms serve as vital components of web development, enabling websites to collect user data and facilitate
            interaction. By mastering the basics of HTML forms and understanding form validation techniques, you'll be equipped to
            create dynamic and user-friendly web experiences.</p>
